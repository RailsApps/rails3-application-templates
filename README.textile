h2. Suggested Use

You can quickly generate a Rails web application using just the @rails new@ command. In practice, experienced Rails developers typically add an assortment of useful additional packages (known as RubyGems, or just "gems") before beginning development of any web application. A developer often uses the same set of gems to get started and may create a "starter app" that can be copied and reused for any new project. Often a developer will create an "application template" to automate the creation of starter apps.

Rails application templates are Ruby scripts used with the @"rails new myapp -m"@ command to generate a Rails web application.

Application templates commonly integrate popular gems that many Rails developers include in a starter app. It can be a hassle to integrate some of the most commonly used gems, particularly when new versions are released and there are minor "gotchas" that interfere with gems working together. By using these  application templates, you'll have a ready-to-run app without the integration "gotchas". Each has a detailed tutorial so you'll see exactly how the application was assembled.

You can use the application templates from this repository to generate a starter app directly. You can edit the templates to customize the script to generate a customized starter app. Or you can use the "Rails Apps Composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem to assemble a selection of recipes for a customized starter app.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2

See "Installing Rails 3.2":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for detailed instructions and advice.

h2. Generating the Application

Use the @"rails new myapp -m"@ command to generate a Rails web application.

This creates a new Rails app (with the @myapp@ name you provide) on your computer.

You can add the @-T -O@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Active Record files.

h4. Template for Rails 3 + Haml + HTML5

This application template will offer you a choice of Haml or ERB, give you options for a CSS front-end framework such as Twitter Bootstrap, and create a default application layout using HTML5:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-haml-html5-template.rb
</pre>

h4. Template for Rails 3 + Devise + RSpec + Cucumber

To build the "rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber":http://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber/  example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber-template.rb -T
</pre>

Use the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files.

h4. Template for Rails 3 + Twitter Bootstrap + Devise + CanCan

To build the "rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan":http://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan/  example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan-template.rb -T
</pre>

Use the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files.

h4. Template for Rails 3 + Mongoid + Devise

To build the "rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-devise/ example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-mongoid-devise-template.rb -T -O
</pre>

Use the @-T -O@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Active Record files.

h4. Template for Rails 3 + Mongoid + OmniAuth

To build the "rails3-mongoid-omniauth":http://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-omniauth/ example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-mongoid-omniauth-template.rb -T -O
</pre>

Use the @-T -O@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Active Record files.

h4. Template for Rails 3 + Subdomains

To build the "rails3-subdomains":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-subdomains example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-subdomains-template.rb -T -O
</pre>

Use the @-T -O@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Active Record files.

h2. Application Template Default

The @rails new@ command creates a new Rails application. If you want to use a template for every Rails application you build, you can set options for the @rails new@ command in a *.railsrc* file in your home directory. Here's how to set up a *.railsrc* file to use the rails3-haml-html5 template when you create a new Rails application:

<pre>
# ~/.railsrc
-m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/master/rails3-haml-html5-template.rb
</pre>

h2. Troubleshooting

Problems? Check the "issues":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/issues.

h4. Problems with Rake

If you see:

<pre>
The template ... could not be loaded.
Error: You have already activated rake 0.8.7, but your Gemfile requires rake 0.9.x.
Consider using bundle exec.
</pre>

If you are using Ruby 1.9.2, you must update the standard Ruby installation from Rake 0.8.7 to Rake 0.9.2 (or "newer":http://rubygems.org/gems/rake) before using the application templates to generate a new Rails app. It's advisable to update to Ruby 1.9.3 which will provide Rake 0.9.2. See "Installing Rails 3.2":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html.

h4. Problems with  "Certificate Verify Failed"

Are you getting an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See suggestions to resolve the error "Certificate Verify Failed":http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

h2. Documentation and Support

This is the only documentation.

h4. The Recipes

For your reference, here's an annotated list of available "recipes for the Rails Apps Composer gem":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-apps-recipes.html. For an up-to-date list, browse the repository "recipes directory":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/tree/master/recipes.

h4. Customizing the Template

If you wish to "change the recipe" to generate the app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file. However, it is better to use the "Rails Apps Composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem to create a new application template. You'll find newer versions of the recipes that make up the application template. You may find issues have been identified and (perhaps) fixed. And it will be easier to maintain your application template if you work from the "Rails Apps Composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html.
